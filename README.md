# embed-graphic-in-python-plot

This repository provides some examples on how to use matplotlib and altair for embedding images in plots.

* "basic matplotlib example" - Contains very simple code for superimposing an image in a plot using matplotlib.
* "basic zoomable altair example" - Contains very simple code for superimposing an image in a plot using altair.
* "chessboards and trajectories" - Contains more complex code for generating customized chessboard and superimposing them over automatically detected clusters in a dataset of chess openings using matplotlib. Also contains code on how to create splines for trajectories in matplotlib.
* "penguins" - Contains a simple example of how superimposing images can be used in the analysis process in a projection space.
* "trajectory splines" - Contains a copy of the Rubiks cube solution with a simple example of how splines can be used to make the path bundles more easily readable.
